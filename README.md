# kaggle-titanic-tensorflow-dnn
Kaggle's titanic problem attempted by TensorFlow NN - Sample model

This python code attempts to do the following
- some moderate preprocessing of data using pandas and numpy
- creates a tensorflow model
- manually varying hyperparameters (epoch, hidden layers, learning rate, batch, etc) and testing the output
- makes use of ReLU and Softmax & cross entropy cost minimizing
- achieves a score of up to 0.74 in kaggle
- further research can be done based on this and the model can be improvised

NOTE: Deep NN models are effective only with large data sets and "deep model" hierarchies. This is just a sample model built to show how to do it in tensorflow to start with.
